## How It Works

1. Run `server.py`.
2. Open the `reader.html` file in your browser.
3. Click the `Clipboard monitoring` button. (Browsers require user interaction for activating autoplay, which is why this is not active by default.)
4. Copy some text to your clipboard.
5. The reader will start reading the text!

Deactivate clipboard monitoring to stop the reader from reading unrelated texts.

**Todo**: Add speed control. For now, I suggest using *Global Speed* ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/global-speed/), [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/global-speed/jpbjcnkcffbooppibceonlgknpkniiff), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/global-speed/mjhlabbcmjflkpjknnicihkfnmbdfced)) for adjusting the reading speed.
