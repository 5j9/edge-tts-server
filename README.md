How it works
-
1. Run `server.py`.
2. Open `reader.html` file in browser.
3. Click "Clipboard monitoring" button. (browsers require user interaction for activating autoplay, that's why this not active by default.)
3. Copy some text into clipboard.
4. The reader start reading the text!

Deactivate clipboard monitoring to stop the reader from reading unrelated texts.

Todo: add speed control. For now, I suggest using *Global Speed* ([firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/global-speed/), [chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/global-speed/jpbjcnkcffbooppibceonlgknpkniiff), [edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/global-speed/mjhlabbcmjflkpjknnicihkfnmbdfced)) for adjusting the reading speed.
