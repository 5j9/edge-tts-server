## How It Works

1. Run `server.py`.
2. `reader.html` should automatically open in your browser.
3. Click the `off` button to toggle it to `on`. (Browsers require user interaction for activating autoplay, which is why this is not `on` by default.)
4. Copy some text to your clipboard.
5. The reader will start reading the text!

The reader will ignore texts shorter than 30 characters or texts that do not contain space.

If the reader tab frequently goes to sleep, add the reader URL to the "Never put these sites to sleep" list in your browser settings.

**Todo**: Add speed control. For now, I suggest using *Global Speed* ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/global-speed/), [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/global-speed/jpbjcnkcffbooppibceonlgknpkniiff), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/global-speed/mjhlabbcmjflkpjknnicihkfnmbdfced)) for adjusting the reading speed.
