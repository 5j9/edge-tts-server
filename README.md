## How It Works

1. Run `server.py`.
2. Open the `reader.html` file in your browser.
3. Click the `off` button to toggle it. (Browsers require user interaction for activating autoplay, which is why this is not active by default.)
4. Copy some text to your clipboard.
5. The reader will start reading the text!

The reader will ignore texts shorter than 30 characters or texts that do not contain space.

**Todo**: Add speed control. For now, I suggest using *Global Speed* ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/global-speed/), [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/global-speed/jpbjcnkcffbooppibceonlgknpkniiff), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/global-speed/mjhlabbcmjflkpjknnicihkfnmbdfced)) for adjusting the reading speed.
